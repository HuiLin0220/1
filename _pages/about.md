I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at iVPL lab at Northwestern University, with main research efforts on generative AI and multi-modal pre-training problems. Previously, I got my Ph.D degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, studying the federated learning and model robustness problem in computer vision. I received the B. Eng (honors) degree from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University in 2018.
