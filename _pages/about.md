I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at iVPL lab at Northwestern University. My research focuses on deep learning- and computer vision-based detection, segmentation, and generation in the areas of manufacturing and medical imaging. My first two years were spent studying automatic defect detection and thermal prediction during additive manufacturing; then, I worked on organ segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation on MRI, OCT, X-ray, etc. Previously, I obtained a master's degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), in 2019. I received a B. Eng in Materials Processing and Control Engineering from Qiming College, HUST, in 2016.
